Requirements:
-) ubiquitous_bash.sh

Special Abilities:
-) Other virtualization platforms like QEMU, VirtualBox, and VMWare are possible. However, those which lock the disk image (at least VirtualBox) may not support multiple instances of one VM.
-) Advanced features like Unity mode, drag and drop, and record/replay are supported.

Special Constructions:
-) The Y:\shell.bat batch file must be called on startup.
-) Theoretically, VM state saving may be used to skip the boot process.
-) When multiple instances and instant-off safety are desired, the VM disk image must be opened in a snapshot mode. With VMWare, this may be accomplished using temporary clones.
-) The NetBIOS protocal may need to be disabled to prevent duplicate network name errors.

Workarounds:
-) Environment variable SEE_MASK_NOZONECHECKS set to 1 combined with adding host IP to trusted sites and lowering all security settings seems to have eliminated XP SP2 new program execution warning.
-) For some reason, it seems to be necessary to have mounted the Z: drive to a samba share at least once before launching the VM under snapshots and expecting it to work.

ChangeMe's:
-) The loader.bat file will need to reflect a valid SAMBA account and root
share for the host machine. Unless of course, the virtualization software
provides its own filesystem integration.
-) The preCommand text file will need to reflect the basic command Windows should execute (eg. notepad.exe ). Command should be preceeded by desired start flags (eg. /MAX) followed by a single space.
-) The execVM.sh file may need to be edited to reflect USB devices, or other low-level changes to the virtualization environment.
-) The execVM.sh file may also require editing if vmplayer is desired over the full VMWare Workstation interface.

Warnings:
-) Beware VM is accessed read-write by cloning operations in the production of snapshots.
-) Temporary clones may consume considerable disk space in /tmp/IQemu. Ensure adequate space is available, and clean the folder after bad crashes.
